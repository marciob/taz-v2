{"prompt":" tell me what is Sempahore\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Semaphore is a zero-knowledge protocol that allows you to cast a signal (for example, a vote or endorsement) as a provable group member without revealing your identity. Additionally, it provides a simple mechanism to prevent double-signaling. Use cases include private voting, whistleblowing, anonymous DAOs and mixers.###"}
{"prompt":" tell me what are the features of Semaphore\n\n###\n\n","completion":" With Semaphore, you can allow your users to do the following: Create a Semaphore identity. Add their Semaphore identity to a group (i.e. Merkle tree). Send a verifiable, anonymous signal (e.g a vote or endorsement). When a user broadcasts a signal (for example: a vote), Semaphore zero-knowledge proofs can ensure that the user has joined the group and hasn't already cast a signal with their nullifier. Semaphore uses on-chain Solidity contracts and off-chain JavaScript libraries that work in tandem. Off chain, JavaScript libraries can be used to create identities, manage groups and generate proofs. On chain, Solidity contracts can be used to manage groups and verify proofs.###"}

{"prompt":" tell more about what is UniRep \n\n###\n\n","completion":" UniRep is a private and non-repudiable reputation protocol built on Ethereum using zero knowledge proof technology. The protocol offers a system where users can: 1. Anonymously give positive and negative reputation to others. 2. Receive positive and negative reputation from other anonymous users while not being able to refuse to accept the reputation (non-repudiable). 3. Voluntarily prove that they have at least a certain amount of reputation without revealing the exact amount. Using UniRep, we can build applications that provide people with new types of experiences where they can build private reputation. Named after Universal Reputation, UniRep technology allows people to easily apply their reputation across multiple communities using interoperable smart contracts all while preserving user privacy using zero knowledge proofs. This allows us to reimagine how existing web applications work. Many services from online shopping, social media to the sharing-economy, not to mention blockchain applications leverage reputation systems and could benefit from this approach.###"}

One use case, which we are working on, is a social media application on top of UniRep, let’s call it UniRep Social for this post. The motivation is to foster open dialogue among anonymous users who are all participating with only the reputation they’ve built up within platforms using the UniRep Protocol. Imagine Alice has an account on a reddit-like platform and has received a lot of karma from other users. A minimum amount of karma is required to make posts in some subreddits and other users will take posts of accounts with high Karma scores more seriously. One day Alice wants to make a post about something that she doesn’t want to be associated with for the rest of her internet life. She could create a new account on the platform but this would mean she needs to start accumulating karma from scratch. Using UniRep we can allow Alice to stay completely private but still accumulate karma and allow her to prove her karma score to others.###"}
{"prompt":" Why a UniRep use case for Social Media app matter\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Traditional social media apps have built entire economies around public reputation. The more content (regardless of quality) and engagement with that content (positive or negative) the greater the reputation can be. It costs nothing to post, comment or like/dislike cultivating a reactive communication environment. Following are some of the issues caused by public, reputable protocols: - Public figures often receive irrelevant responses to their posts regardless of their posts intellectual merit (or lack thereof). People with few followers can go unheard regardless of the quality of what they have shared. - People with few followers can go unheard regardless of the quality of what they have shared. - Anyone can receive a response skewed by the threat of social repercussions if the opinion they post differs from their followers expectations. Public prominence (or lack thereof) need not influence the collective attention paid to any post or comment. The community anonymously chooses which anonymous content creators it empowers and disempowers. Furthermore, if a person chooses to share their reputation score, it can be proven that they meet a selected threshold without revealing their exact reputation.###"}
{"prompt":" give me a high level explanation about UniRep\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The following is a high level overview of the UniRep protocol. We use the social media application UniRep Social as an illustrative example. If you are interested to learn more stay tuned for a more detailed post or dive right in on Github. To begin, let us define the two different actors who interact with the UniRep protocol: users and attesters. Users can receive and spend reputation, prove their reputation, and use temporary identities called epoch keys to interact with other people. Users can generate five new epoch keys every epoch (per example, 7 days). In a way, the user gets a completely new identity every epoch which preserves their privacy. Attesters represent users to give reputation to an epoch key. Attester IDs are public and unchangeable so users can always prove that the reputation is from the attester. In the UniRep Social example an attester would be the UniRep Social application and Users are users of the application who vote on each other’s comments.###"}
{"prompt":" explain an example about how registration would work in Unire use case for social media app\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Users and attesters use different ways to sign up in UniRep. User: A user generates identity and identity commitment through Semaphore. Semaphore is a zero-knowledge gadget which allows Ethereum users to prove their membership of a set which they had previously joined without revealing their original identity. The user hoIds the identity like a private key, and the identity commitment is like a public key that is submitted to the UniRep contract. Attester: The attester uses his own wallet or the address of a smart contract to register. After calling the attester sign up function, the UniRep contract will assign an attester ID to this address. Whenever the attester gives an attestation, the UniRep contract will check whether the address is registered. If it is registered, the attester is allowed to give reputation to an epoch key. Note: Everyone can sign up as an attester with their wallet address and will receive a new attester ID.###"}
{"prompt":" explain an example about how giving reputation would work in Unire use case for social media app\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Only epoch keys can receive attestations. After Alice signs up to UniRep, she can generate epoch keys to receive reputation. These epoch keys change every epoch, are unique to every user and look completely random. In the UniRep Social example users can make posts with their epoch keys. Now, when a user sees a post made by an epoch key, how can others know that it is indeed from a registered user? And how can they be sure that the epoch key is computed correctly with the current epoch and a valid nonce? Alice can not simply provide this information since this would enable everyone to calculate what reputation Alice has received, removing the desired privacy. This is where zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) come into play. A ZKP is used to prove that the epoch key is valid without revealing additional information. For details, please refer to the epoch key proof, which proves that the user is indeed registered, and the epoch and nonce are valid numbers. The user can see the epoch_key in the post and the epoch_key_proof provided by Alice, and verifies them through the UniRep contract, and then can give an attestation through the attester (in our example UniRep Social) to the epoch key. Users can also spend reputation if it makes sense for the application. They would generate a reputation proof about their current amount of reputation and the attester will send a negative reputation to decrease the balance. Spending reputation is a way for users to give reputation to other users through an attester without having to register as an attester themselves.###"}
{"prompt":" explain an example about how receiving reputation would work in Unire use case for social media app\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A user can prove which epoch key she owns and everyone can easily query how much reputation the epoch key has from the contract. A user that has received some bad reputation during a certain epoch could decide not to show those epoch keys to other users. Therefore, after an epoch ends and all epoch keys are sealed, UniRep restricts users to generate a User State Transition proof that is used to update their reputation status. The User State Transition Proof is used to ensure that the user calculates the latest user state in the correct way, and the user does not miss any attestation. In other words, after an epoch is over, Alice can collect reputation from other users (via UniRep Social) through User State Transition and update her reputation status.###"}
{"prompt":" explain an example about how proving reputation would work in Unire use case for social media app\n\n###\n\n","completion":" After Alice performs a User State Transition, she will have the latest user state. At this time, Alice can prove to everyone on the platform how many reputation points she has in UniRep Social through a reputation proof. The reputation proof checks whether the user exists, has the claimed reputation (for example it sums up positive and negative reputation from specified attester IDs), and performs User State Transition. For privacy reasons it could be disadvantageous to reveal the exact amount of reputation one has received. If Alice has 100 karma in total, UniRep allows Alice to prove that she has “at least 10 karma” instead of revealing that the total is 100.###"}
{"prompt":" tell me more about what is UniRep and why it's good\n\n###\n\n","completion":" UniRep s a reputation system with privacy protection. Thanks to ZKP magic, users can receive reputation, give reputation, and prove reputation to others anonymously. UniRep can be used for cross-application reputation certification. One can obtain reputation in application A, and prove in application B how much reputation is obtained. If you want to learn more about UniRep, you can refer to Github (https://github.com/UniRep/UniRep), documents (https://UniRep.gitbook.io/UniRep/) or join the Discord channel (https://discord.gg/VzMMDJmYc5) to discuss.###"}
{"prompt":" what is the high level goal for UniRep\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The high-level goal for UniRep is to be a base layer on top of which anyone can easily build custom, yet interoperable, reputation systems. For instance, users could create combined zero-knowledge proofs of reputation across different social media platforms, consumer apps, or financial applications in order to provide holistic, private, and trustworthy information about themselves to others.###"}
{"prompt":" why UniRep is important\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Anonymity gives people a clean slate to express themselves, unconnected to an existing identity. Reputation provides context: it reveals an aspect about a person’s history in relation to others. UniRep protocol adds reputation to anonymity, allowing people to provide relational context without revealing specifics of their history.###"}
{"prompt":" what UniRep name stand for\n\n###\n\n","completion":" UniRep stands for Universal Reputation and serves as a base layer for applying reputation across multiple communities using interoperable smart contracts while preserving user privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.###"}
{"prompt":" talk about the role of reputation in online services\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Reputation is relational: it is built on claims about a person’s behavior or character. It’s also subjective and context-dependent. It can take a qualitative form such as a reference letter from an acquaintance or an Airbnb review, or it can be an upvote or downvote on Reddit, or a positive or negative integer in a database. Many of the apps and services we depend on wouldn’t work without reputation acting as a reference for deciding whether and how to interact with strangers on the internet.###"}
{"prompt":" what is the role of UniRep in online services\n\n###\n\n","completion":" UniRep protocol is a standard on which different reputational rules can interoperate. It doesn’t dictate how reputation is used in a given application, but instead functions as a generic and extensible system where platforms such as AirBNB, Uber, Reddit, Medium, Trip Advisor, or Trust Pilot would be attesters: providers of negative or positive reputation.###"}
{"prompt":" talk more about attesters\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Attesters are at the application layer. They are the platforms, businesses, and communities in the ZK social ecosystem. They act as world builders and community managers. Attesters have great flexibility in what to build. They decide how many user identities are used, how users are onboarded, and how users interact with each other. Most importantly, attesters decide why someone receives a positive reputation and why someone receives a negative reputation. In other words, attesters provide accountability. Attesters use publicly known Ethereum addresses while user identities are always kept private. Users receive reputation from attesters and can create a zero-knowledge proof verifying they have a certain level of reputation from a certain attester. UniRep users are always in control of how their reputation is used: only they can see how much they’ve accrued and only they have the power to reveal their reputation – and only to who they want.###"}
{"prompt":" how UniRep started and what does it do\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The UniRep protocol evolved from an ethresearch proposal by Barry WhiteHat for a system where users could be banned or have their reputation destroyed even if they are anonymous. The proposal outlined a mechanism for giving positive and negative reputation in a way that the user must accept while maintaining privacy. To guarantee reputation is non-repudiable (cannot be refused) UniRep employs a system of epochs, temporary identities, and the migration of reputation and user information from one state to the next via ZK proofs.###"}
{"prompt":" help me to better understand what are epoch keys and epochs\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Reputation is accumulated to users via rotating identities called epoch keys. Epoch keys can be thought of as temporary Ethereum addresses that change regularly but are tied to a persistent user, which preserves anonymity for users while maintaining the history needed for a meaningful reputation. Epochs represent the ticking of time. Similar to blocks in a blockchain, they can be thought of as cycles in the UniRep system: with each transition, the reputation balances of all users are finalized and carried over into the new epoch. Each attester sets their own epoch length. Epoch keys are created from an identity commitment generated via Semaphore, a generic privacy layer where users can anonymously send signals from within a group. Inside of a Semaphore group, users’ actions are unconnected to their “outside” identities. Instead of interacting with people as a uniquely identifiable individual, Semaphore identities are expressed simply as a member of the group. Epoch keys change every epoch, are unique to every user, and look completely random. Only the user knows if they are receiving an attestation or reputation; others would see only an attestation to a random value. Epochs and changing epoch keys help preserve privacy by mixing up where reputation accrues and what identities people use to interact.###"}
{"prompt":" why and how UniRep use Merkle Tree\n\n###\n\n","completion":" UniRep uses a system of migrating Merkle tees to maintain reputation and privacy at the same time. Merkle trees are data structures capable of efficiently storing and verifying information; reputation and user data are stored as leaves in UniRep’s Merkle trees. Proving a UniRep reputation means generating a proof that a user’s claim (their reputation level) exists in a valid Merkle tree. When users first sign up, their data is entered into a State Tree. Each attester has their own separate version of a State Tree, which changes every epoch. State Trees can be thought of as the meta reputation tracker for a specific attester: containing relevant UniRep users and their starting reputations at the beginning of an epoch. Since epoch keys are temporary, the reputations they accumulate must be migrated to a new Merkle tree. When users transition into the new epoch, they receive new epoch keys and the old epoch keys become invalid. In the background, their reputation follows them to the next iteration of an attester’s State Tree via ZK proofs. Moving to the new State Tree means creating a User State Transition Proof verifying the user followed all the rules of the protocol. The proofs show there was no cheating: no omitting negative attestations or adding fraudulent positive attestations. The user generates a User State Transition proof containing a new state tree leaf containing the attester ID, the user’s Semaphore identity nullifier, sum of the user’s positive and negative reputation from the previous epoch, timestamp and “graffiti” - a value given to the user by the attester. This new leaf is provided to the smart contract, which verifies the proof and inserts it into the new State Tree. Once a user accrues reputation, they can prove how many reputation points they’ve accumulated through a reputation proof. The reputation proof is a ZK proof that verifies the user exists, has the claimed reputation, and has performed all the necessary transitions or migrations. The reputation proof makes sure the user’s claims are consistent with the data in the State Tree.###"}
{"prompt":" how Zero Knowledge and UniRep related to the future of social networks dapps\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are many parallel efforts to reimagine and rearchitect online social systems to be more decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant. Though different in their approaches, all these initiatives are creating basic building blocks for identity and reputation, then playing with different ways to stack the structure. Efforts such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Decentralized Society (DeSoc), peer-to-peer networks and Federated universes or networks allow anyone to join in, express themselves, and have the freedom to choose how they connect and participate with others. In these systems, users own their accounts, their data and their social graphs; users can choose how they interface with the network; and independent servers or systems are able to talk to each other by default. When we hear \"social applications\" we tend to think of social media platforms like Twitter or Reddit – but restaurant reviews, marketplaces, rideshares and homestays are all highly social and highly dependent on reliable reputation systems. ZK social or ZK identity share many of the principles of the decentralized social efforts mentioned previously, but ZK social starts with privacy as the foundational layer to build upon – which is especially important in use cases like homestays that cross into “real life” – and uses zero-knowledge proofs as the primary mechanism to make claims about identities or reputations. UniRep protocol is one building block in the ZK social stack. Adding on complexity and data to an anonymous system allows people to regain the color that is lost when users can’t be individually identified. Building social primitives from scratch means having to consider and experiment with new ways to layer in constraints, rules, and feedback mechanisms.###"}
{"prompt":" what UniRep protocol accomplished in 2022\n\n###\n\n","completion":" you can know about that by reading that blog post from December 2022 in the official website: https://developer.unirep.io/blog/year-in-review-2022 / Here is the entire transcription: 2022 was an exciting year for UniRep, and we had our first highlight moments in April during Devconnect, and we were finally able to show the public what we have been building in the past months. Although it was exciting, we quickly realized that our synchronizer could have been more optimal. It broke on 2nd day of the event, which caused the user state transition to fail. It was also challenging to debug such an event. That was the first lesson learned for us in 2022. Right after the Devconnect, we took a step back to visit all the core components. The action of refracting is about time. Before April 2022, it was the exploring phase, we weren't entirely sure how to approach...etc. There were many to-do lists on the table. One of the fascinating learning was on the demo app (attester), we realized that if we automatically airdrop Rep to anyone who signs up, it would cause infiltration and un-equality, but every attester has different needs. We went a long way in debating on how this attester should be experienced and came up with the solution of subsidy. We head down 100% between April and October to make it happen. During this time, we also iterated on how to work as a team and started using GitHub issues to manage our workflow and set up a two weeks sprint. Right now, the team is focused on protocol v2. We have been releasing small pieces since December, along with create-UniRep-app, the idea is to enable everyone to build their own app (attester) easily.

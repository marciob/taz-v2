{"prompt":"How does the UniRep protocol handle negative reputation?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The UniRep protocol handles negative reputation by allowing attesters to assign both positive and negative reputation to users. Negative reputation is accumulated in the same way as positive reputation, and the user's reputation balance is the sum of both positive and negative reputation. Users can prove their reputation, but the exact value of reputation is kept private through the use of zero-knowledge proofs. Additionally, attesters are responsible for providing accountability for assigning negative reputation, and users have the option to prove their reputation while keeping the exact value private.\n###"}
{"prompt":"How does the UniRep protocol ensure that reputation is non-repudiable?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The UniRep protocol ensures that reputation is non-repudiable by using a system of temporary identities and epochs. When a user receives reputation, they are assigned a temporary identity called an epoch key, which changes every epoch. This key is tied to a persistent user, preserving the user's reputation history. Additionally, reputation is accumulated to the epoch key, and when the key changes, the reputation is migrated to the new key. This system ensures that users cannot refuse to accept reputation and that reputation is tied to a specific user identity, making it non-repudiable.\n###"}
{"prompt":"How does the UniRep protocol ensure interoperability between different reputation systems?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The UniRep protocol ensures interoperability by providing a standard on which different reputational rules can interoperate. The protocol functions as a generic and extensible system, allowing platforms such as Airbnb, Uber, Reddit, Medium, Trip Advisor, or Trust Pilot to be attesters, providing negative or positive reputation. By using the UniRep protocol, these different platforms can easily communicate and share user reputation, providing a holistic and trustworthy reputation system. Additionally, the use of smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs ensure that reputation is verified and private.\n###"}
{"prompt":"How does UniRep protocol handle privacy while maintaining reputation history?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" UniRep protocol handles privacy by using a system of temporary identities (epoch keys) and zero-knowledge proofs. Each user is assigned a temporary identity, the epoch key, which changes regularly but is tied to a persistent user. This allows users to maintain a reputation history while preserving their anonymity.

{"prompt":"How does UniRep protocol handle the migration of users' reputation across different platforms?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" UniRep protocol uses a system of migrating Merkle trees to handle the migration of users' reputation across different platforms. Each platform (or attester) has its own State Tree, which is a meta-reputation tracker that contains relevant UniRep users and their starting reputations at the beginning of an epoch. When a user transitions to a new epoch, their reputation follows them to the next iteration of the attester's State Tree through ZK proofs. These proofs, called User State Transition Proofs, verify that the user followed all the rules of the protocol and that there was no cheating. The proofs also contain a new state tree leaf which contains the attester ID, the user’s Semaphore identity nullifier, sum of the user’s positive and negative reputation from the previous epoch, timestamp, and graffiti. \n###"}

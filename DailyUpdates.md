## Jan 16-20 Updates
### Delivered
- Chapter 1 first draft with different outlines
- [About the Game HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@patzip/BJLkNDwij)
- UX first looks
- AI chat for Semaphore and Unirep protocols is in better shape

### To be worked on
- Deliver working game, Chapter 1 with Story and Challenges
- Implementation of story outline with Unirep and Semaphore

## Jan 9-13 Updates
### Decisions made
- We'll develop a writing choice-based RPG
- "Reputation" Unirep mechanism will be used to store data for each Stats. There's a limit of 32 stats with 0-255 points.

### To be worked on
- Chapter 1
- Game mechanics
- UX for challenges and game interactions (text, choices, character, stats, challenges, combat)
- Back end
- AI chat for Semaphore and Unirep protocols has documentation

## Jan 2-6 Updates

### Achieved
- Good fluency and understanding around documentation of Unirep and Semaphore

### General Discussion
- comparison between users and GPT answers, and the game is for users to guess which is correct; not super engaging.
- choose a beta use case
- propose Reputation in Study Groups. Reputation will be part of a positive cycle with several interaction opportunities; is a useful case.

- what we've understood about Unirep
- what game/ application will we create?

### Game/ App Discussion
- Have rounds and levels;
- Leaderboard: levels with enough points instead of showing how many points (keep reputation anon)
- Battlezip: is it useful for for developers to get familiarized with Unirep if they need to learn another layer? Perhaps we should find a new route (new game, new application)
- Instead of game, we could create a plugin
- Open Ideas
    - art competition
    - story telling together
    - study group epochs based on shared research items
    - discord integration
    - engaging mechanic for voting: hot or not hot/ yes or no

### Open Questions
- can we have a larger epoch cycle? (Danilo)
- can we have multiple epochs running in parallel? Or tasks/ situations/ etc

### Goals

### for Wednesday, Jan 11th
- create a chatbot about Unirep and Semaphore

## **Sync #3 January 10th, 2023**
continue working
ideas discussed:
- comparison between users and GPT answers, and the game is for users to guess which is correct; not super engaging.
- choose a beta use case
- propose Reputation in Study Groups. Reputation will be part of a positive cycle with several interaction opportunities; is a useful case.

## **Sync #2 January 9th, 2023**

### Main Topics
- what we've understood about Unirep
- what game/ application will we create?

### Game/ App Discussion
- Have rounds and levels;
- Leaderboard: levels with enough points instead of showing how many points (keep reputation anon)
- Battlezip: is it useful for for developers to get familiarized with Unirep if they need to learn another layer? Perhaps we should find a new route (new game, new application)
- Instead of game, we could create a plugin
- Open Ideas
    - art competition
    - story telling together
    - study group epochs based on shared research items
    - discord integration
    - engaging mechanic for voting: hot or not hot/ yes or no

### Open Questions
- can we have a larger epoch cycle? (Danilo)
- can we have multiple epochs running in parallel? Or tasks/ situations/ etc

### for Wednesday, Jan 11th
- create a chatbot about Unirep and Semaphore
- propose changes in Unirep documentation
- Unirep implementation with step-by-step
- try all the repos for Semaphore

### for Thursday, Jan 12th
- show new documents;
- propose some game options;
